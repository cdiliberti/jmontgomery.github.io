Learn how to interpret the results. 9.1 Let’s start with a couple of good videos 9.2 Basic visulualization Now go back to the PSenergy data we used in the last chapter. Follow those instructions to open the data as an object called energyData. 9.2.1 Making your first plots We use R to create many different kinds of plots: hist(energyData$Energy, xlab=&quot;Television Stories&quot;, main=&quot;Title&quot;) boxplot(energyData$Energy, ylab=&quot;Television Stories&quot;, main=&quot;Title&quot;) plot(y=energyData$Energy, x=energyData$Approval,ylab=&quot;Television Stories&quot;,xlab=&quot;Presidential Approval&quot;) plot(x=energyData$Energy, ylab=&quot;Television Stories&quot;,xlab=&quot;Month-Year&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;) 9.2.2 Saving your plot You can save your plot by re-creating it within a “pdf device.” In essence, R will create the plot as a new file rather than on your screen. library(lattice) getwd() pdf(&quot;stories_over_time.pdf&quot;) densityplot(energyData$Energy, xlab=&quot;Television Stories&quot;) dev.off() Do not forget the dev.off or the file will never be rendered. 9.3 Try a bit more on your own.
