# Installing R and R Studio

## What is R?

- R can be used for many different purposes. It is a programming language, a letter, a piece of data analysis software, and a community with over 2 million users.
- R is open source and completely free, so if you ever encounter a problem, you can go online and the R community will try to help you out.

- R's open source nature also means that you can contribute! If you discover or develop something, the R community would love to learn about it. 
- We will use R in our Lab sections, to complete problem sets, and you will use it to analyze data for the final presentation. 
- Many large companies use R to analyze data, so this experience will be useful in the long run and we recommend maintaining your R knowledge even after this class is over.
