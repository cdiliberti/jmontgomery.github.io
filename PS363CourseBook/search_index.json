This year, this course has been revised to incorporate some elements of Team Based Learning. This is an approach to creating permanent groups to work on problems in class, in lab, and out of class throughout the semester. We are not going to follow the TBL approach strictly. But we are going to have fewer lectures and more structured group activities. Learn more about Team Based Learning by watching this video. 1.2 Learning object #2: What is the point of all of these online activites? A better question would be what is the point of sitting in a room and watching a professor talk? It’s 2017! Moving an increasing amount of teaching resources online is a big trend in education at all levels. But this isn’t just trendy, it appears to be very effective. Preliminary research shows that online learning paired with in-class interactions with faculty is a much more effective than the traditional lecture format. Watch this short TED talk by Peter Norvig to learn more: 1.3 Learning objective #3: How is this going to work? The approach I am trying to adopt for this class is to help you learn in four basic steps. Initial exposure to materials through self-study. Repeated exposure to materials in short lectures. Use your new knowledge in a collaborative environment where assistance is readily available. Use your new knowledge on your own. The goal is for you to see and use information in multiple ways to improve learning outcomes. Experience (and research) shows that this approach is far superior to simple lectures in helping you learn more and retain it longer. To help you along this process, each learning component will be broken down as follows. You will read your book and review online materials. Regular online quizzes will help motivate you to stay current. I will begin most classes with a short lecture where I will cover the materials again and answer questions. You will apply your knowledge during in-class team assignments. If you have any questions or run into problems, I will be right there to give you help. To keep the team motivated, these assignments will be graded. You will apply your knowledge on your own (or with friends) in your problem sets. "],
["measurement-error.html", "2 Measurement Error 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 Learning Objective 1: Types of Biases asdf 2.3 What’s the takeaway?", " 2 Measurement Error 2.1 Learning Objectives Learn to define the following types of errors: sampling bias, response bias, non-response bias 2.2 Learning Objective 1: Types of Biases asdf If the goal of a survey is to be representative, then anything that causes a survey to deviate from the population is a major problem. Something that causes a survey result to deviate from the population is referred to as bias. Bias can be introduced in a number of ways. We will divide biases into three categories: sampling bias, response bias, and non-response bias. 2.2.1 Sampling bias Sampling bias occurs when there is a problem in the sampling process. Sometimes, the sample is poorly conducted. For example, in a survey of WashU undergraduates, if we put together a stratified sample, based on residential area, and then selected 50% of our subjects from Shepley Hall, then our survey would not be reflective of the general WashU undergraduate population, because 50% of WashU students do not live in Shepley hall. This is a sampling error. To give a political example, in telephone surveys, sometimes people do not pick up their phone. In this situation, most polling firms will try calling back later. If a firm does not try to call back when people are out, then they run the risk of introducing sampling error, because younger people are more likely to be out than older people, and younger people are more likely to be liberal. Other times, a sample simply isn’t random. Certain groups are systematically left out of a sample. This is called a selection bias, or selection effect. In this case, the sample will fail to reflect the population as a whole. Although this may sound like an obvious problem, this happens all the time. For example, hosts at various cable news shows sometimes ask viewers to text in what they think about a certain policy, and then display the results as if they are reflective of the general population. But just because 93% of people who texted in think that the President should be re-elected does not mean that the population as a whole agrees. Since it is not a randome sample, it doesn’t even mean that 93% of viewers agree! A common situation where sampling error occurs involves phone lines. People without phone lines are excluded from most surveys. That may not be too big of an issue in a country like the United States, where there may not be a substantial difference between people with phone lines, and people without them. But in a country like Afghanistan relying on phone calls to conduct a survey would be a very big problem since phones are only owned by (relatively) wealthy individuals and some areas have no service at all! Another example is Geico commercials, where they say that people who switch to Geico on average save money. This is a selection bias, because only people who are offered a cheaper rate will switch. If people were randomly selected and forced to switch to Geico, then they would not be saving 30% or more. 2.2.2 Response bias In some surveys, the questions may be poorly worded. The language may be ambiguous, or may be open to different interpretations. So the process of answering the questions may lead to some bias in how the questions are answered. In some surveys, something about the survey itself causes subjects to respond differently than they would in real life. For example, if someone is being surveyed on how often they volunteer, and (s)he rarely volunteers, (s)he may feel embarrassed or guilty about this fact, and tell the interviewer that (s)he volunteers frequently. This is called the social desirability effect. For example, if a survey asks someone if they voted in the last election, and they had not, that person may be more inclined to answer untruthfully, because failing to vote is frowned upon. Other times, the ordering of questions might affect responses. For example, if a survey begins by asking subjects numerous questions about terrorism, and then asks them to list the issues most important to them, more subjects might list terrorism than would be the case if the survey had not first asked numerous questions about it. This is referred to as order effect. An example of order effect occurred in a survey in 1948 that asked, Q1: Do you think the US should let Communist newspaper reporters from other countries come in here and send back to their papers the news as they see it? But half of the people were first asked, Q2: Do you think a communist country like Russia should let American newspaper reporters come in and send back to America the news as they see it? Among people who were first asked the question about American reporters (Q2), 73.1% said yes to Q1. But, among people who did not first answer Q2, only 36.5% said yes to Q1. 2.2.3 Non-response bias People don’t always respond to surveys. When people who do not respond to surveys differ in some systematic way from people who do respond, then the sample fails to be representative of the general population. For example, students who submit course evaluations tend to do so because they either disliked their professor, or loved their professor. In a class, students who do not have strong feelings one way or another are less likely to submit an evaluation, so the evaluation results are likely to indicate that the class is more polarized than it actually is. Note: Non-response bias is not the same as selection bias. Selection bias has to do with how the sample was constructed by the researcher. Non-response bias has to do with how individuals chosen to be in the sample behave. 2.3 What’s the takeaway? There are several different ways that a survey can fail to reflect the population. The sample itself could not be reflective of the population, which would be a sampling bias. Sometimes, something about the survey could prompt people to give answers that don’t reflect what they actually believe or do, which is a response bias. Other times, the people who are selected, but don’t respond differ in an important way from people who do respond, causing the results of the survey to be skewed. This is called a non-response bias.

["scales-of-measurement.html", "3 Scales of Measurement 3.1 Learning Objectives: 3.2 Learning Objective 1: Scales 3.3 Summary: 3.4 Learning Objective 2: Granularity 3.5 What is granularity? 3.6 What are the takeaways?", " 3 Scales of Measurement 3.1 Learning Objectives: Learn what ordinal, nominal, and interval scales are. Be able to distinguish between them. Learn what “granularity” means, learn what the two types of granularity, continuous and discrete, mean, and learn how to distinguish them 3.2 Learning Objective 1: Scales 3.2.1 First of all, what do we mean by scales? A “scale” is just the way we measure or quantify a variable. There are three different scales with which data can be measured: nominal, ordinal, or interval. 3.2.2 Nominal Scale Variables measured on a nominal scale can be separated into different categories, but they have no natural ordering. We can’t say that one data point is “more something” than another point. One example is conenent. It is possible to put countries into different categories based on the continent they’re in. The reason that continent is a nominal variable is that, while we can put countries into different categories, there is no universal, objective way of putting them along a dimension. Note: Sometimes variables measured on a nominal scale are called “categorical” data. 3.2.3 Ordinal Scale: Variables measured on an ordinal scale have a natural ordering, but no natural distances between them. We can put the data points in a conceptual line, but there isn’t a precise (or meaningful) distance between observed values. Many survey questions measure opinion on an ordinal scale. For example, in 2012 The Pew research Center asked: Is your overall opinion of Barack Obama very favorable, mostly favorable, mostly unfavorable, or very unfavorable? We can be pretty sure that people who respondend “very unfavorable” approved less of President Obama than people who responded “mostly unfavorable.” But how much less? We don’t know exactly, which is why this variable is measured on an ordinal scale. (You can see many more examples of question wordings to measure approval Preisdent Obama here.) 3.2.4 Interval Scale: Variables measured on an interval scale have both a clear ordering and the difference between numbers has a clear meaning. We can not only put data points in a line, we can also position them within precise distances from each other. An easy example is height. We can order everyone in QPM in a line, from tallest to shortest, and we can say precisely how much taller (or shorter) one person is than the others. 3.2.5 Ratio scale: Ratio scale is a subset of Interval data. In a ratio scale, the zero value signifies that there is none of that variable. Most scales in social science are ratio scales. For example, if we were to measure the proportion of the time a legislator votes with the leadership of a certain party, then a score of 0% means that that legislator cast no votes with the party leadership. An example of a scale that is not measured on a ratio scale is temperature measured in Fahrenheit or Celsius. If a room is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius, that does not mean that there is no warmth. 3.2.6 Focus on the measurement and not the concept Certain variables, when measured in different ways, can be measured with different scales. For example, think about political ideology. One way to measure the ideology of a member of Congress would be to ask them if they are “Very liberal, somewhat liberal, somewhat conservative, or very conservative.” This would have an ordinal scale. However, there are other ways to measure ideology. For example, we could measure the proportion of votes each member cast that were consistent with the Republican leadership. This would allow us to make a scale of ideology that is interval. (We might find that Nancy Pelosi’s voting record is 70.2% more liberal than John Boehner’s.) Below is the link to Congressional rankings released by Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing political group, and rankings released by the Club for Growth, and right-wing political group. http://www.adaction.org/media/votingrecords/2010.pdf http://www.clubforgrowth.org/projects/ 3.3 Summary: Watch this video for a very nice summary of these concepts and some thoughts on how best to plot them. 3.4 Learning Objective 2: Granularity 3.5 What is granularity? Granularity refers to how answers fit on a scale. If a variable can take on any value along a scale, it is continuous. An example of a continuous variable is the proportion of the vote a candidate receives in an election. A candidate can receive 0%, 100%, or any value in between. If a variable can only take on certain (countable) values, it is discrete. All nominal data are discrete. Consider the following survey question, asked in a poll by Rusmussen Reports (full survey here): A proposal has been made to repeal the health care law and stop it from going into effect. Do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose a proposal to repeal the health care law? In the above question, the results would be discrete, because there are only 5 possible answers. Respondents can strongly favor, somewhat favor, some oppose, or strongly oppose the proposal. There is no possible answer between strongly favor or somewhat favor, for example. Here is a video that can help you tell the difference between discrete and continuous data. 3.6 What are the takeaways? Based on whether data have a natural order or natural distance, they can be measured on a nominal, ordinal, or interval scale. A specific type of interval scale is a ratio scale. Some variables, measured in different ways, can potentially be measured on several types of scales. Based on the space between answers, or granularity, scales can either be continuous, if variables can take on any value on the scale, or discrete, if they can only take on certain values. This video will help you keep this all straight. "],
["random-samples.html", "4 Random Samples 4.1 Learning Objectives 4.2 Learning Objective 1: Random Samples 4.3 Learning Objective 2: Types of Random Samples 4.4 What are the takeaways?", " 4 Random Samples 4.1 Learning Objectives 1)Understand what a random sample is, and why random samples are important. 2)Identify simple random samples, systematic random samples, stratified random samples, cluster samples, and multi-stage sampling, and understand why scientists use them. 4.2 Learning Objective 1: Random Samples 4.2.1 What is a random sample? A random sample is a sample where every subject in the population in question has an equal chance of being selected. If there are 6,000 undergrads at WashU, and I want to select 600 to be in my sample, then if my method of selecting subject is random, each undergrad has the same chance of being selected, 10%. 4.2.2 Why do we care if a sample is random? We want our samples to be representative. In other words, we want our sample to look like the population we’re drawing from, just smaller. If we are conducting a study on how happy they are with their dorm, and 10% of WashU undergrads live in a “traditional” dorm on the South 40, then we want 10% of our sample to be comprised of students living in a traditional dorm on the South 40. More technically, random samples are representative in expectation. That means that if we took a lot of different random samples, on average they would be representative. So while any one random sample might be off just a bit, random samples in general will be representative. 4.2.3 Real-life application: Don’t look ignorant in your newspaper column Below is the link to an article by Rodger Simon, Politico’s chief political columnist. In this article, he dismisses polls because they ask so few people what they think. This is a perfectly reasonable argument to make if one has had no background in statistics. What Roger Simon failed to grasp, and the reason why polls work, even though they ask such few people, is that, when they are done well, they are representative of the population as a whole. http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1211/70717.html 4.3 Learning Objective 2: Types of Random Samples There are several different types of random samples. In each of these samples, every subject in the population has the same probability of being selected, but the subjects are selected in different ways. 4.3.1 Simple Random Sample: This is the most basic method of sampling. A certain number of subjects are chosen randomly out of a population. An example of this is lotteries. In a lottery, each number has the same chance of being selected. Here’s a helpful video that explains simple random samples: If simple random samples are representative, why not just use them for all samples? The problem is that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to put together a simple random sample for large populations. One challenge is that certain groups have different response rates than other groups. In this case, if we just do a simple random sample, then groups that have a higher response rate will be over-represented. Another challenge is that there is no directory with the names and contact information of every single person, so it can be difficult to put together a sample in the first place. Scientists employ more complex sampling methods to remedy these problems. 4.3.2 Systematic Random Sample: In a systematic sample, subjects are selected through some sort of system. For example, I might collect the student id numbers of all WashU undergrads, order them from least to greatest, and then start with the 8th number, and sample every 10th person. This is still a random sample, because each person has the same chance of being selected. It’s not, however, a simple random sample, because instead of being selected entirely randomly in no order, there was a system to choosing the people. In a simple random sample, every set of people has the same chance of being in the sample. In a systematic random sample, that’s not true. For example, if my student ID number is 1 higher than my roommate’s, then the in a simple random sample it’s possible that both my roommate and I will be in the sample. In the systematic random sample I just described, however, it is impossible that my roommate and I will be in the same sample. Everyone in the sample has a student id number that’s 10 apart. Here’s a helpful video that explains systematic random samples: 4.3.3 Stratified Random Sample: In a Stratified Random Sample, we first split the population into different groups, or strata. We then select a set number of subjects from each group. The goal is to set up the samples such that the proportion of subjects in the sample from each strata match the proportion of subjects from each strata in the population. To return to the example of sampling the undergraduate population of WashU, we might divide undergrads into different strata based on their residential area. If 5% of all WashU undergrads live in Mudd Hall, and we want our sample to be 600 people, then 5% of those 600 people, or 30 people, will be from Mudd Hall. To achieve this, we would do a simple random sample of Mudd residents, choosing 30 subjects. And we would do this for each residential area. Here’s a helpful video that explains stratified random sampling: What are the advantages of a stratified random sample? Stratified Random Samples can be used to remedy problems of over-sampling, or under-sampling. If different groups have different rates of response, then we can select more subjects from those groups, so the set of people who respond are representative. For example, if freshmen respond much less to surveys than upper-classmen, then we might use a stratified random sample, and over-sample freshmen, to correct for this. 4.3.4 Cluster Samples: In a cluster sample, the population is divided into different clusters. These are organic groupings of people. A simple random sample is run to select several clusters, and then everyone in each selected cluster is surveyed. For example, in the WashU undergrad survey, we might “cluster” students by floor. Wheeler 1 would be a cluster, Lopata 3 another, and so on. We would randomly select a few floors, and interview everyone on each floor. Here’s a helpful video that explains cluster sampling: What are the advantages of a cluster sample? In some ways, cluster samples are easier to execute. If many of the people we are interviewing live close together, it might be easier to reach them. Of course, cluster sampling is not without its drawbacks. Because subjects in the same cluster tend to be similar in certain systematic ways, the cluster sampling can lead to over-sampling of certain types of people. 4.3.5 Multi-Stage Sampling: A multi-stage sample employs several types of random samples. For example, for the undergrad survey, we might first stratify WashU undergrad by whether they live on the South 40, in the Village, or off campus. We might then do a cluster sample within each strata. We could choose 4 floors from each strata, and interview each person on that floor. 4.4 What are the takeaways? Random sampling is the way scientists develop representative samples. There are several different ways of putting together random samples. These include cluster samples, stratified random samples, systematic samples, and multi-stage samples, which combine aspects of different sampling methods. "],
